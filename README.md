Seismograph Sample App for NativeScript (Loading an embedded framework)
=============================
The NativeScript framework already provides a fairly comprehensive set of standard UI controls that you need to build an app. But what if you want to build an app with the NativeScript framework using a 3rd-party library? 

This repository contains the complete Seismograph sample app which demonstrates the usage of an embedded (dynamic) framework in a [NativeScript](http://github.com/nativescript/nativescript) project. The complete blog article describing the steps to build the project, loading the embedded framework, can be found here: [Using 3rd-party iOS Frameworks in your NativeScript Apps](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/using-3rd-party-ios-frameworks-in-your-nativescript-apps).

> Loading Static Libraries: The NativeScript framework can load static libraries too. For more information, refer to the following GitHub repo: [sample-iOS-StaticLibs](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-iOS-StaticLibs).
